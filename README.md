## Features

This plugin allows you to replace unnecessary words or phrases with symbols inside of your editor, without losing the functionality of the code. The plugin advocates for **readability** and puts the configuration in the hands of the users. Any word or phrase can be converted into a symbol or left blank to abstract away excess bloat and allows your eyes to focus on the important parts of the code.
